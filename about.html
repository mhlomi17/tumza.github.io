		<p> Decoy records/productions is a production started by two Chistian young men.It gradually grew to a much better production.Mainly the production records Hip hop but does not prohibit other genres.</p>
		<p> We believe that in order for an artist to record a hit song the artist does not need to use strong language like swearing.There's no swearing or any inappropriate language on our artist's songs.
            We promote what we call pure good music,creativity and uniqueness.
        <p> Our artist also record Gospel-type Hip hop songs but they are not permanently Gospel artists they record  songs out of the box too.</p>
